1,detective batman at its peak great storyline just as dark a universe as weve come to expect from dc the gloomy gritty dark tone of this film is exactly what i wanted when you think the movie is over theres more beautiful cinematography great score,positive
2,i just got out of the batmanthis movie really wont be for everyone easily the darkest batman movie yet it is gritty depressing and not a fun movie at allthis isnt your usual comic book movie its a detective movie with more in common with seen than previous batman movies the first two thirds of the movie are amazing at one point i turned to my son and said this is a masterpiece everything works and is brilliant i was  enthralled but boy does it drop the ball in the final actof the cast pattinson is great collin farrell is ok zoe kravitz was fine too but she has zero chemistry with pattinson keaton and pfeiffer they are not paul dano though was incredible especially in the scene in arkham whilst geoffrey wright is as great as he always ison the downside it does have some pacing issues and is really too long though im not sure what id cut and i really wasnt keen on the ending i dont know if it is a comic book storyline they did as i think the final act really lets the movie down its here in the final act that you feel the movies run timei was surprised there were only  other people in my screening,negative
3,i have been absolutely fizzing to see the batman from the day it was announced but even more so from when i first heard it described as being inspired by seen  one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time were we finally going to get the raw and gritty batman film id always dreamed of seeing we certainly werewhere to begin the biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with batman as batman there is very little of bruce wayne in this movie and im absolutely fine with that the movie is batmans story and we are with him from start to finish we even get some narration from him which im not quite sure how i feel about just yet it was very good narration but im not sure hes a character i want it fromthe riddler in this movie is phenomenal after the joker in the dark knight this is absolutely my second favourite batman film villain he was clearly inspired by the zodiac killer and what an inspired choice also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius these are very clever riddles and puzzles and make batman have to do some serious detective work  something ive always wanted more of from him in the previous filmsthis is my favourite incarnation of catwoman to date i havent loved her characters place in the films in the past ive found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of batman that i havent enjoyed in this film though she was used perfectly shes the love interest and a villainantihero all in one that is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a batman film  the pointless love interestthe penguin was probably the one letdown for me from what id seen in the trailer i suspected this may be the case im wondering if they were using this movie as a setup for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do in this one though i just found him quite a dull screenpresencerobert pattinson as batman blew me away he looked great and his voice was perfect he was extremely intense and very menacing even though i knew he was more than capable of playing the role i think i still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes he absolutely did and then somethe film has quite a unique feel there are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both tim burtons batman universe and christopher nolans universe but then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of the batman it basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into its own style  while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also its very well done in that sensethe batmobile in this movie is awesome theres just no other way to put it the sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bonechilling the chase sequence in this movie with the penguin is one of the best ive ever seenthe film is long at just under  hours but it really never feels like it theres a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while that really is the only flat part of the movie however the rest happens at a breakneck paceits hard to find enough good things to say about this movie i need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer but for now i have it firmly sitting in second place behind the dark knight in my order of favourite batman films,neutral
4,the riddlerpaul dano spoton how did it take this long for him to get a role like this targets public officials revealing their corruption and killing them in gruesome fashionhow did this get away with a pg again oh right as long as you dont show the details then you can get away with almost anything by now even a barely toned down jigsaw in order to stop him it will be necessary for the bat and the catwith amazing chemistry together to stop the rat thanks matti really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with bruce waynes alterego how about nightwing i know its not likely but part of me still holds out hope that grayson will be turned into a featureif youve never checked out the trailer on youtube youre missing out but somehow this managed to convince me fingers crossed for at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast the closest weve come to someone who shouldnt be doing it is george clooney and its not like anybody came out of that flick looking good he took that job after doing from dusk till dawn there was good reason to think that he was going to be badass honestly everyone here gives a strong performancesomething that will definitely appeal to some more than others is the genre and tone this is essentially seen meets zodiac it is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster while the action is great especially the martial arts not to mention that car chase theres less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the nolan trilogywhich also has far more escalation essentially this just isnt focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon and i think we can all agree that weve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested in conveying to the audience that theres a reason hes called the worlds greatest detective weve barely seen it outside of the animated ones before so im very happy with that choice by themin addition to what ive already mentioned this features some drugs suggestive material and strong language i recommend this to any fan of batman ,positive
5,star rating  brilliant  very good  okay  poor  awfulgotham city is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures by a sadistic killer calling himself the riddler paul dano who holds the city to ransom revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped the batman robert pattinson the alter ego of millionaire bruce wayne starts an investigation of his own crossing paths with a woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz who operates as catwoman and wants to find out what happened to her friend it sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of gothams underworld including notorious gangster the penguin an unrecognisable colin farrell and crime boss carmine falcone john turturro who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their livesthe batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation here writerdirector matt reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever less doesnt seem to be more anymore at least not to the cinema artistes but from this end all i can see is a film drowning in its own indulgencereeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak heavy tone established by christopher nolan and so we have a gotham city with seemingly endless heavy rain and gloomy skies set against pattinsons dark brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack its just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light even more overdone is danos dark riddler operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous thrown in to this is the topical social justice speeches that litter film and tv today with kravitzs catwoman even praising the sinister villain who were meant to hate at one point for killing all these white privileged aholes its just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket over ambitious and overlong and by the time of the main villains grand master plan at the end youre too overwhelmed or bored to careeveryone else can think what they like but personally this is one of the most pretentious batmans ever which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent or at least had an old fashioned lawrence of arabia style intermission at some point,negative
6,everything about this movie is trying too hard  the over dramatic score the long shots on characters faces the overacting the complex crime story  it all feels like its trying to get an oscar in every momentits overly long drawn out and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into itthis movie is not a masterpiece but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is,negative
7,im not sure where to begin as i dont generally want to spoil the reveals but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic for the batman matt reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as batman year one hush and batman the long halloween reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as the french connection zodiac and the noir classic chinatown the general feel of the movie sought to relate batman in the detective role that hes famous for in the comics but unfortunately ignores any attempt at batmans level of crime  mysterythe acting was really good theres a great cast of professionals in this film although robert patterson isnt allowed a range of emotion bruce wayne and batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emokid who walks through life with severe lethargy colin farrell is unrecognizable as the penguin and dare i say gave the greatest performance of his life a large portion of the film is writing out a semiorigin story for oswald cobblepot and his rise to become gothams crime boss a lot of the villains are the origin stories here batman the character is basically introduced the way he is in batman year two and i thought that was a mistake year one of batman would have been wonderful on screen the audience seeing bruce wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movies everyone is just scared of him plot device zoe kravitzs performance as selena kyle becoming cat woman was underdeveloped as she was so much fun to watch in the batman that id like to see this spinoff into a standalone cat woman release jeffery wright was brilliant of course even remaining quiet in the batmans background he pulled the attention onto himself mostly because pattersons portrayal was incredibly stiff paul dano as the riddler was exactly what i wanted to see in this movie the character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with carmine falcone john turturro was great as the crime boss falcone but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings it dragged on so long that it bored me completely i went into the batman to see him match wits with a clever serial killer not be reeducated about the connection between thomas wayne  carmine falcone againthe action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way i knew before hand that reeves lifted from some older better known films but its as if they dropped the budget on these scenes batman racing to catch the penguin was an old muscle car batmobile versus what im guessing was a s buick i was laughing at this chase scene it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if penguin were in an expensive italian sports car i might have enjoyed it but it was literally a suppedup car desperately trying to out pace my moms car the fighting was dull hand to hand combat is one of the first things bruce wayne learns before donning the cowl but in this movie batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at so much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills that i wondered where the editor wasthe batman is simply too long its a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of its own significance it fails at cohesive storytelling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score unlike the dark knight before it  i wont watch it again,negative
8,matt reeves the batman is a hell of a movie it is the darkest live action batman movie ever made and the longest one too the batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting but its cinematic too the cinematography was just incredible michael giacchino the batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever its enduringly great the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when batman shows up it really making me hyped more because of that colin farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as the penguin paul dano performance is giving me a heath ledger joker vibes but not trying to be heath ledger joker which is still great paul dano the riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain zoe kravits performances as catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as michelle pfeiffer and the catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for zoe and i did still like her a lot in here and in the end we got the batman himself robert pattinson all i can say about him as the batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play the batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome batman now he was become my second favorite batman next to christian bale in number one still the story of the batman itself is great and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow its not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster if its only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that but at in the end the batman is still a hell of a great movie its still amazing and its still incredible i was impress by most of the thing that happens i was excited i was hyped i was stunt by all the amazing thing that theyve done the batman is fire,positive
9,the headline can be taken two ways if you remove any hype or expectations saying its a good movie is positive but if you are hoping for an amazing new batman iteration good means it wasnt great let alone amazingthis review will come off as negative but i did enjoy it i love the tone its super dark and grounded in reality even more than the nolan trilogy and it feels true to the character zoe kravitz and jeffrey wright are great casting choices its a mostly wellmade film and a good addition to the franchise and the bat suit looks awesomeat the same time nothing about this movie wowed me i did not connect with the characters especially the villain the relationships seem undeveloped and not organic i was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as i should have been it mostly feels surface levelif youre a huge batman fan i think you will really enjoy it but as a movie i dont think it fires on all cylinders the nolan trilogy still reigns supreme  viewing fan early screening,neutral
10,wasnt a fan of emo batman sorry robert pattinson film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate christopher nolan and david fincher in the end the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a runofthemill superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill the riddler was a bit lame too forgotten most of the movie and characters already underwhelming,negative
11,couldnt even finish this drivel firstly  pattinson is a good actor but doesnt fit batmans role film is way too long and boring  action is underwhelming overall a big disappointment cant recommend it at all,negative
12,i went in with ultralow expectations because i think robert pattison is a godawful actor and this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that you can always go lowerim actually angry i wasted  hours of my life and trust me every minute of that time was felthowever lets have some positives cinematography is great and the music is fantastic the opening scenes with the batman made me think i was going to have another heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something specialbut then the film gets going part saw ripoff and so desperately wants to be seen in its execution the story dragged you dont care about any of the characters and i found myself pining for clooney and his batnipples and mr freezewhat i found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with nolan and warned him were going to make a better batman than you no just nolike the last lord of the rings film this has an ending that just keeps on coming something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave the film continues something else is wrapped up and you think thats it and it keeps going something else and on and on and oni can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through and no im not joking welcome to southamptonwith regards to the plank of wood sorry pattison in the initial scenes i was genuinely excited never a fan of his costume before seeing it here  suddenly i got it he proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack they get back up in fact everyone he batpunches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again theres no real threat here when bale smacked someone down they stayed dead but then when bale stripped off same as affleck they were built robert looked like me and i look like mr burns from the simpsons a skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever in fact when robert bent over in one topless scene his bones stuck out and i thought wings were going to pop out but then why wouldnt they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role i would have sacked him there and thenhis time as bruce is strictly limited  thank god  so you cant really judge him for that as bruce he just stands there and looks confused as the batman by the end he became a parody his batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke batman in the college humour videos a is for alfred  genius when he was mad it just look like he was pulling a cumface and dont even get me started on the adrian mole diary keeping thats going in with the voiceover narrationhonestly with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so i have never hated a film so much as i did this and given i went in with low expectations even i am surprised at how fuming i am at myself for wasting my time on it,negative
13,matt reeves is not a good director at all hes made one decent film rise of the planet of the apes and everything else hes done falls into one of two categories junk and overrated junk thank goodness the batman is at least the latter instead of the former if the director wasnt trying sooooo hard to make the film dark maybe he could have created a new category of just overratedfirstly david fincher himself is bad enough but david fincher imitations are even worse this movies rote serialkiller plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that nolan already played around with most notably the but he wanted to be captured eyeroller also irritating are reeves cheap attempts to desecrate schuberts music while indulging the trope of the classical musicloving psychopath modern cultures obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peevesthey are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same exchange the riddler for any of the killers in finchers movies and there is basically no difference and it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the riddlers petty mind games  if i was there i would promptly tell him to pss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere even if there was a bomb strapped to my necksecondly the casting is sometimes bizarre dc has often thrived on unorthodox castingif they can make ben affleck work as batman anything goesbut they trip up here since we have the highwater mark of the nolan trilogy to compare it to andy serkis as alfred that completely does not work he just lacks the sophistication of michael caine the new commissioner gordon is no gary oldman thats for sure the riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate heath ledger the riddler from the  batman show was vastly superiorheck jim carrey was the new catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry on and on about some friend of hers that ends up killed why shes so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even batman dares solve the closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable colin farrell as the penguin the car chase scene was great even as i kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the roadthirdly the pacing is off ive seen people accuse nolan of being portentous but the batman takes it to a whole new level with its bloated runtime it doesnt even have the quasigrandeur of the snyder cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the penguins club ad nauseam reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by alfred hitchcock but other than a rear window throwback in the opening scene i dont see it the film is mostly shot like a generic tv procedural filtered through a david fincher lens and reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made hitchcock so sublime compare any riddler murder to the one in dial m for murder which is one of the more mediocre hitchcocks reeves sole technique for suspense is to have the riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters aboutugh if any good this would have become dcs highest grossing film ever as it is people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop,negative
14,the batman  is a movie my wife and i caught an advanced screening of last night the storyline follows gotham shortly after the batman has emerged and established himself in the streets a serial killer known as the riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within gothams hierarchy until bruce wayne in inevitably the target how are all of these people tied together and can batman tie the pieces together before wayne is the next victimthis movie is directed by matt reeves cloverfield and stars robert pattinson twilight zo kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano there will be blood john turturro do the right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord of the rings jeffrey wright shaft and barry keoghan eternalsthe storyline look and feel of this movie is an a the characters are perfectly cast and well executed farrell dano and kravitz were a this movie does a fantastic job of depicting the batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent this also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end this has a very good jeph loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the detective elements of batman the violence was also brilliant and very well done i will say this did not need to be hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited this film likely should have been a hair under  and a half hoursoverall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for batman fans i would score this a   and strongly recommend it,positive
15,the batman   robert pattinson zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell paul dano john turturro andy serkis peter sarsgaard filmmaker matt reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the bob kane comic book hero with pattinson standing tall and brooding as bruce wayne employing vigilante style justice as the caped cursader while gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal riddler dano affectively disturbing and gaining an unlikely ally in selina kyle asskicking kravitz in precatwoman mode arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by greig fraser and james chinlunds production design all aided by the foreboding score by michael giacchino full of bombast and dread farrell under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics has a field day in getting in touch with his inner robert de niro as the penguin by all means see it in imax,positive
16,i will say i liked the story but the long dragged out and slowly paced near  hours was ridiculous you could watch this at x speed and it would be more enjoyable this needed at least  mins cut out and much faster storytelling and the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fasti do like pattinson as an actor but not as batman in this one he wasnt convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy and thats him both as batman and even more so as bruce wayneand whats with colin farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the penguin was every other actor that naturally has that characters look unavailable its not like farrell has a particular set of penguin skills lol casting farrell as batman and pattinson as penguin now that wouldve worked much better imoim also a big fan of westworlds jeffrey wright but here again he was very unconvincing as gordon especially when he also had that monotonic whispering emo demeanor i get that director and joint writer reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme but instead the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throatsthe only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful kravitz who stole the entire show i wouldve rather watched a  hour movie with just her as catwomanall the affleck keaton bale kilmer and even clooney batman characters were much more convincing as well as having more and better keep you awake action in said filmssadly this one is a generous yet disappointing  from me,negative
17,robert p is a terrible batman absolutely no batcharisma at all the riddler character is a complete bore i hated all of this film i certainly do not understand the good reviews its not close to the dark knight caliber please do not make a sequel,negative
18,for better or worse mostly better the batman is when hes detective first superhero second a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesnt hurt really if were having a new batman film especially if it took a riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together,neutral
19,to preface this review i will say when watching this in the cinemas many people walked out i was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie deliversthe actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain the riddler and the batman penguin was by far the coolest and best actor honestly a good fellas type character all other supporting actors were also quite good i however think robert pattinson a horrible pick for batman the whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid i was half expecting him to say gosh get outta my room absolutely trash acting the riddler was even worse he was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable his video calls reminded me of the horror films my  year old class mates had made in high school their budgets were the relationship between the batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie the romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension they rode around in their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cutethe bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a batman film the old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lienow to answer everyones questions i do think robert pattinson was a terrible choice for batman for a few reasons at first i had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role he just isnt a badass over masculine kinda guy like at all he seems awkward and it shows his voice wasnt that great his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad the guy is ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors the story was god awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die bombs go off and some personal people batman knows get injured then batman goes welp i cant be in  places at once im only human and proceeds to get kod twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights he is by far the worst and weakest looking batman with the worst actor to have played him the cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible did i mention this film is  hours long to have a crap middle and end well know i know wow i couldnt wait for thr  hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished definitely wouldnt reccomend this garbage piece of cinema  for me,negative
20,i never thought that i would view a worse dc movie than catwoman or the harley quinn movie i was sorely mistaken the batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation the casting was wrong  there was not one cast member who had a good performance the script was pitiful  it was too long and all over the place the direction was terrible and the editing was questionablenothing was a positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery,negative
21,ill say it started pretty good and i liked the cinematography but i thought it dragged on and the social commentary on destroying white privileged men was ironic as thats what batman is a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because hes rich and has all the free time to do so and we feel for him because boo boo hes an orphan this was a very obvious woke fest i like the diversity but its when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey pattinson was so sleepy like joe biden in a batman suit sleepy joker is my favorite movie of all time and i feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps i did like farrell as the penguin and the riddler was basically dexter the antihero,neutral
22,its a big city i cant be everywhere batman rob pattisona more complete adaptation of the batman comics presence there isnt and no more gothic spoton condemnation of human frailty since the yearold godfather writerdirector matt reeves the batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the american soul in its corruption and its salvation as an achievement of robust american neo noir it ranks somewhere behind martin scorseses taxi driver and godfatherbatman rob pattinson scowls as if he came from a twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for selena kylecat woman zoe kravitz the bat and the cat working to save the city from the likes of riddler paul dano penguin colin farrell and crime lord carmine falcone john turturro besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees they offer bruce wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents public and private lives and their untimely deaths although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of heath ledgers multidimensional joker even in his humor together they are a powerful cast of darknessbesides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role reeves gathers expert cinematographer greig fraser and production designer james chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time dark yes obscure no the darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise couldbesides the corruption of city officials the batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance embodied in waynes longing to account for the death of his parents and badboys like riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city in his favor riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals his stalwart ally lt james gordon jeffrey wright realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisorsthe batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve at least not right nowto the strains of nirvanas baleful something in the way they think im hiding in the shadows but i am the shadows batman,neutral
23,hours hero movieit might be quite an adventure for those who expect actionpacked movies like avengers or the dark knightthe batman is not an action movie its a noir detective filmjust enjoy the dark moisty mood this movie hasif you enjoyed movies like zodiac seen im sure youll love itgo to the theatre immediately,positive
24,i got to watch this movie early because of a special screening i was extremely excited my expectations were very high and still they were surpassedrobert as batman is just awesome majestic and scary and yet at the end he also evokes that sense of hope batman gives to the populationpaul dano as the riddler is so creepy both robert and paul gave an oscar worthy actingthe rest of the cast gives amazing performances toobeautifully shot and the score is thrillingit does feel a bit long but it is rewarding,positive

26,detective batman at its peak great storyline just as dark a universe as weve come to expect from dc the gloomy gritty dark tone of this film is exactly what i wanted when you think the movie is over theres more beautiful cinematography great score,positive
27,i just got out of the batmanthis movie really wont be for everyone easily the darkest batman movie yet it is gritty depressing and not a fun movie at allthis isnt your usual comic book movie its a detective movie with more in common with seen than previous batman movies the first two thirds of the movie are amazing at one point i turned to my son and said this is a masterpiece everything works and is brilliant i was  enthralled but boy does it drop the ball in the final actof the cast pattinson is great collin farrell is ok zoe kravitz was fine too but she has zero chemistry with pattinson keaton and pfeiffer they are not paul dano though was incredible especially in the scene in arkham whilst geoffrey wright is as great as he always ison the downside it does have some pacing issues and is really too long though im not sure what id cut and i really wasnt keen on the ending i dont know if it is a comic book storyline they did as i think the final act really lets the movie down its here in the final act that you feel the movies run timei was surprised there were only  other people in my screening,negative
28,i have been absolutely fizzing to see the batman from the day it was announced but even more so from when i first heard it described as being inspired by seen  one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time were we finally going to get the raw and gritty batman film id always dreamed of seeing we certainly werewhere to begin the biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with batman as batman there is very little of bruce wayne in this movie and im absolutely fine with that the movie is batmans story and we are with him from start to finish we even get some narration from him which im not quite sure how i feel about just yet it was very good narration but im not sure hes a character i want it fromthe riddler in this movie is phenomenal after the joker in the dark knight this is absolutely my second favourite batman film villain he was clearly inspired by the zodiac killer and what an inspired choice also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius these are very clever riddles and puzzles and make batman have to do some serious detective work  something ive always wanted more of from him in the previous filmsthis is my favourite incarnation of catwoman to date i havent loved her characters place in the films in the past ive found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of batman that i havent enjoyed in this film though she was used perfectly shes the love interest and a villainantihero all in one that is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a batman film  the pointless love interestthe penguin was probably the one letdown for me from what id seen in the trailer i suspected this may be the case im wondering if they were using this movie as a setup for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do in this one though i just found him quite a dull screenpresencerobert pattinson as batman blew me away he looked great and his voice was perfect he was extremely intense and very menacing even though i knew he was more than capable of playing the role i think i still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes he absolutely did and then somethe film has quite a unique feel there are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both tim burtons batman universe and christopher nolans universe but then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of the batman it basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into its own style  while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also its very well done in that sensethe batmobile in this movie is awesome theres just no other way to put it the sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bonechilling the chase sequence in this movie with the penguin is one of the best ive ever seenthe film is long at just under  hours but it really never feels like it theres a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while that really is the only flat part of the movie however the rest happens at a breakneck paceits hard to find enough good things to say about this movie i need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer but for now i have it firmly sitting in second place behind the dark knight in my order of favourite batman films,neutral
29,the riddlerpaul dano spoton how did it take this long for him to get a role like this targets public officials revealing their corruption and killing them in gruesome fashionhow did this get away with a pg again oh right as long as you dont show the details then you can get away with almost anything by now even a barely toned down jigsaw in order to stop him it will be necessary for the bat and the catwith amazing chemistry together to stop the rat thanks matti really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with bruce waynes alterego how about nightwing i know its not likely but part of me still holds out hope that grayson will be turned into a featureif youve never checked out the trailer on youtube youre missing out but somehow this managed to convince me fingers crossed for at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast the closest weve come to someone who shouldnt be doing it is george clooney and its not like anybody came out of that flick looking good he took that job after doing from dusk till dawn there was good reason to think that he was going to be badass honestly everyone here gives a strong performancesomething that will definitely appeal to some more than others is the genre and tone this is essentially seen meets zodiac it is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster while the action is great especially the martial arts not to mention that car chase theres less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the nolan trilogywhich also has far more escalation essentially this just isnt focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon and i think we can all agree that weve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested in conveying to the audience that theres a reason hes called the worlds greatest detective weve barely seen it outside of the animated ones before so im very happy with that choice by themin addition to what ive already mentioned this features some drugs suggestive material and strong language i recommend this to any fan of batman ,positive
30,star rating  brilliant  very good  okay  poor  awfulgotham city is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures by a sadistic killer calling himself the riddler paul dano who holds the city to ransom revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped the batman robert pattinson the alter ego of millionaire bruce wayne starts an investigation of his own crossing paths with a woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz who operates as catwoman and wants to find out what happened to her friend it sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of gothams underworld including notorious gangster the penguin an unrecognisable colin farrell and crime boss carmine falcone john turturro who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their livesthe batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation here writerdirector matt reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever less doesnt seem to be more anymore at least not to the cinema artistes but from this end all i can see is a film drowning in its own indulgencereeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak heavy tone established by christopher nolan and so we have a gotham city with seemingly endless heavy rain and gloomy skies set against pattinsons dark brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack its just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light even more overdone is danos dark riddler operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous thrown in to this is the topical social justice speeches that litter film and tv today with kravitzs catwoman even praising the sinister villain who were meant to hate at one point for killing all these white privileged aholes its just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket over ambitious and overlong and by the time of the main villains grand master plan at the end youre too overwhelmed or bored to careeveryone else can think what they like but personally this is one of the most pretentious batmans ever which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent or at least had an old fashioned lawrence of arabia style intermission at some point,negative
31,everything about this movie is trying too hard  the over dramatic score the long shots on characters faces the overacting the complex crime story  it all feels like its trying to get an oscar in every momentits overly long drawn out and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into itthis movie is not a masterpiece but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is,negative
32,im not sure where to begin as i dont generally want to spoil the reveals but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic for the batman matt reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as batman year one hush and batman the long halloween reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as the french connection zodiac and the noir classic chinatown the general feel of the movie sought to relate batman in the detective role that hes famous for in the comics but unfortunately ignores any attempt at batmans level of crime  mysterythe acting was really good theres a great cast of professionals in this film although robert patterson isnt allowed a range of emotion bruce wayne and batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emokid who walks through life with severe lethargy colin farrell is unrecognizable as the penguin and dare i say gave the greatest performance of his life a large portion of the film is writing out a semiorigin story for oswald cobblepot and his rise to become gothams crime boss a lot of the villains are the origin stories here batman the character is basically introduced the way he is in batman year two and i thought that was a mistake year one of batman would have been wonderful on screen the audience seeing bruce wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movies everyone is just scared of him plot device zoe kravitzs performance as selena kyle becoming cat woman was underdeveloped as she was so much fun to watch in the batman that id like to see this spinoff into a standalone cat woman release jeffery wright was brilliant of course even remaining quiet in the batmans background he pulled the attention onto himself mostly because pattersons portrayal was incredibly stiff paul dano as the riddler was exactly what i wanted to see in this movie the character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with carmine falcone john turturro was great as the crime boss falcone but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings it dragged on so long that it bored me completely i went into the batman to see him match wits with a clever serial killer not be reeducated about the connection between thomas wayne  carmine falcone againthe action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way i knew before hand that reeves lifted from some older better known films but its as if they dropped the budget on these scenes batman racing to catch the penguin was an old muscle car batmobile versus what im guessing was a s buick i was laughing at this chase scene it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if penguin were in an expensive italian sports car i might have enjoyed it but it was literally a suppedup car desperately trying to out pace my moms car the fighting was dull hand to hand combat is one of the first things bruce wayne learns before donning the cowl but in this movie batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at so much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills that i wondered where the editor wasthe batman is simply too long its a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of its own significance it fails at cohesive storytelling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score unlike the dark knight before it  i wont watch it again,negative
33,matt reeves the batman is a hell of a movie it is the darkest live action batman movie ever made and the longest one too the batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting but its cinematic too the cinematography was just incredible michael giacchino the batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever its enduringly great the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when batman shows up it really making me hyped more because of that colin farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as the penguin paul dano performance is giving me a heath ledger joker vibes but not trying to be heath ledger joker which is still great paul dano the riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain zoe kravits performances as catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as michelle pfeiffer and the catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for zoe and i did still like her a lot in here and in the end we got the batman himself robert pattinson all i can say about him as the batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play the batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome batman now he was become my second favorite batman next to christian bale in number one still the story of the batman itself is great and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow its not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster if its only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that but at in the end the batman is still a hell of a great movie its still amazing and its still incredible i was impress by most of the thing that happens i was excited i was hyped i was stunt by all the amazing thing that theyve done the batman is fire,positive
34,the headline can be taken two ways if you remove any hype or expectations saying its a good movie is positive but if you are hoping for an amazing new batman iteration good means it wasnt great let alone amazingthis review will come off as negative but i did enjoy it i love the tone its super dark and grounded in reality even more than the nolan trilogy and it feels true to the character zoe kravitz and jeffrey wright are great casting choices its a mostly wellmade film and a good addition to the franchise and the bat suit looks awesomeat the same time nothing about this movie wowed me i did not connect with the characters especially the villain the relationships seem undeveloped and not organic i was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as i should have been it mostly feels surface levelif youre a huge batman fan i think you will really enjoy it but as a movie i dont think it fires on all cylinders the nolan trilogy still reigns supreme  viewing fan early screening,neutral
35,wasnt a fan of emo batman sorry robert pattinson film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate christopher nolan and david fincher in the end the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a runofthemill superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill the riddler was a bit lame too forgotten most of the movie and characters already underwhelming,negative
36,couldnt even finish this drivel firstly  pattinson is a good actor but doesnt fit batmans role film is way too long and boring  action is underwhelming overall a big disappointment cant recommend it at all,negative
37,i went in with ultralow expectations because i think robert pattison is a godawful actor and this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that you can always go lowerim actually angry i wasted  hours of my life and trust me every minute of that time was felthowever lets have some positives cinematography is great and the music is fantastic the opening scenes with the batman made me think i was going to have another heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something specialbut then the film gets going part saw ripoff and so desperately wants to be seen in its execution the story dragged you dont care about any of the characters and i found myself pining for clooney and his batnipples and mr freezewhat i found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with nolan and warned him were going to make a better batman than you no just nolike the last lord of the rings film this has an ending that just keeps on coming something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave the film continues something else is wrapped up and you think thats it and it keeps going something else and on and on and oni can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through and no im not joking welcome to southamptonwith regards to the plank of wood sorry pattison in the initial scenes i was genuinely excited never a fan of his costume before seeing it here  suddenly i got it he proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack they get back up in fact everyone he batpunches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again theres no real threat here when bale smacked someone down they stayed dead but then when bale stripped off same as affleck they were built robert looked like me and i look like mr burns from the simpsons a skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever in fact when robert bent over in one topless scene his bones stuck out and i thought wings were going to pop out but then why wouldnt they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role i would have sacked him there and thenhis time as bruce is strictly limited  thank god  so you cant really judge him for that as bruce he just stands there and looks confused as the batman by the end he became a parody his batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke batman in the college humour videos a is for alfred  genius when he was mad it just look like he was pulling a cumface and dont even get me started on the adrian mole diary keeping thats going in with the voiceover narrationhonestly with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so i have never hated a film so much as i did this and given i went in with low expectations even i am surprised at how fuming i am at myself for wasting my time on it,negative
38,matt reeves is not a good director at all hes made one decent film rise of the planet of the apes and everything else hes done falls into one of two categories junk and overrated junk thank goodness the batman is at least the latter instead of the former if the director wasnt trying sooooo hard to make the film dark maybe he could have created a new category of just overratedfirstly david fincher himself is bad enough but david fincher imitations are even worse this movies rote serialkiller plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that nolan already played around with most notably the but he wanted to be captured eyeroller also irritating are reeves cheap attempts to desecrate schuberts music while indulging the trope of the classical musicloving psychopath modern cultures obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peevesthey are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same exchange the riddler for any of the killers in finchers movies and there is basically no difference and it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the riddlers petty mind games  if i was there i would promptly tell him to pss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere even if there was a bomb strapped to my necksecondly the casting is sometimes bizarre dc has often thrived on unorthodox castingif they can make ben affleck work as batman anything goesbut they trip up here since we have the highwater mark of the nolan trilogy to compare it to andy serkis as alfred that completely does not work he just lacks the sophistication of michael caine the new commissioner gordon is no gary oldman thats for sure the riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate heath ledger the riddler from the  batman show was vastly superiorheck jim carrey was the new catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry on and on about some friend of hers that ends up killed why shes so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even batman dares solve the closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable colin farrell as the penguin the car chase scene was great even as i kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the roadthirdly the pacing is off ive seen people accuse nolan of being portentous but the batman takes it to a whole new level with its bloated runtime it doesnt even have the quasigrandeur of the snyder cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the penguins club ad nauseam reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by alfred hitchcock but other than a rear window throwback in the opening scene i dont see it the film is mostly shot like a generic tv procedural filtered through a david fincher lens and reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made hitchcock so sublime compare any riddler murder to the one in dial m for murder which is one of the more mediocre hitchcocks reeves sole technique for suspense is to have the riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters aboutugh if any good this would have become dcs highest grossing film ever as it is people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop,negative
39,the batman  is a movie my wife and i caught an advanced screening of last night the storyline follows gotham shortly after the batman has emerged and established himself in the streets a serial killer known as the riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within gothams hierarchy until bruce wayne in inevitably the target how are all of these people tied together and can batman tie the pieces together before wayne is the next victimthis movie is directed by matt reeves cloverfield and stars robert pattinson twilight zo kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano there will be blood john turturro do the right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord of the rings jeffrey wright shaft and barry keoghan eternalsthe storyline look and feel of this movie is an a the characters are perfectly cast and well executed farrell dano and kravitz were a this movie does a fantastic job of depicting the batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent this also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end this has a very good jeph loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the detective elements of batman the violence was also brilliant and very well done i will say this did not need to be hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited this film likely should have been a hair under  and a half hoursoverall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for batman fans i would score this a   and strongly recommend it,positive
40,the batman   robert pattinson zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell paul dano john turturro andy serkis peter sarsgaard filmmaker matt reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the bob kane comic book hero with pattinson standing tall and brooding as bruce wayne employing vigilante style justice as the caped cursader while gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal riddler dano affectively disturbing and gaining an unlikely ally in selina kyle asskicking kravitz in precatwoman mode arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by greig fraser and james chinlunds production design all aided by the foreboding score by michael giacchino full of bombast and dread farrell under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics has a field day in getting in touch with his inner robert de niro as the penguin by all means see it in imax,positive
41,i will say i liked the story but the long dragged out and slowly paced near  hours was ridiculous you could watch this at x speed and it would be more enjoyable this needed at least  mins cut out and much faster storytelling and the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fasti do like pattinson as an actor but not as batman in this one he wasnt convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy and thats him both as batman and even more so as bruce wayneand whats with colin farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the penguin was every other actor that naturally has that characters look unavailable its not like farrell has a particular set of penguin skills lol casting farrell as batman and pattinson as penguin now that wouldve worked much better imoim also a big fan of westworlds jeffrey wright but here again he was very unconvincing as gordon especially when he also had that monotonic whispering emo demeanor i get that director and joint writer reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme but instead the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throatsthe only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful kravitz who stole the entire show i wouldve rather watched a  hour movie with just her as catwomanall the affleck keaton bale kilmer and even clooney batman characters were much more convincing as well as having more and better keep you awake action in said filmssadly this one is a generous yet disappointing  from me,negative
42,robert p is a terrible batman absolutely no batcharisma at all the riddler character is a complete bore i hated all of this film i certainly do not understand the good reviews its not close to the dark knight caliber please do not make a sequel,negative
43,for better or worse mostly better the batman is when hes detective first superhero second a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesnt hurt really if were having a new batman film especially if it took a riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together,neutral
44,to preface this review i will say when watching this in the cinemas many people walked out i was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie deliversthe actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain the riddler and the batman penguin was by far the coolest and best actor honestly a good fellas type character all other supporting actors were also quite good i however think robert pattinson a horrible pick for batman the whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid i was half expecting him to say gosh get outta my room absolutely trash acting the riddler was even worse he was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable his video calls reminded me of the horror films my  year old class mates had made in high school their budgets were the relationship between the batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie the romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension they rode around in their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cutethe bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a batman film the old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lienow to answer everyones questions i do think robert pattinson was a terrible choice for batman for a few reasons at first i had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role he just isnt a badass over masculine kinda guy like at all he seems awkward and it shows his voice wasnt that great his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad the guy is ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors the story was god awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die bombs go off and some personal people batman knows get injured then batman goes welp i cant be in  places at once im only human and proceeds to get kod twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights he is by far the worst and weakest looking batman with the worst actor to have played him the cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible did i mention this film is  hours long to have a crap middle and end well know i know wow i couldnt wait for thr  hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished definitely wouldnt reccomend this garbage piece of cinema  for me,negative
45,i never thought that i would view a worse dc movie than catwoman or the harley quinn movie i was sorely mistaken the batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation the casting was wrong  there was not one cast member who had a good performance the script was pitiful  it was too long and all over the place the direction was terrible and the editing was questionablenothing was a positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery,negative
46,ill say it started pretty good and i liked the cinematography but i thought it dragged on and the social commentary on destroying white privileged men was ironic as thats what batman is a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because hes rich and has all the free time to do so and we feel for him because boo boo hes an orphan this was a very obvious woke fest i like the diversity but its when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey pattinson was so sleepy like joe biden in a batman suit sleepy joker is my favorite movie of all time and i feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps i did like farrell as the penguin and the riddler was basically dexter the antihero,neutral
47,its a big city i cant be everywhere batman rob pattisona more complete adaptation of the batman comics presence there isnt and no more gothic spoton condemnation of human frailty since the yearold godfather writerdirector matt reeves the batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the american soul in its corruption and its salvation as an achievement of robust american neo noir it ranks somewhere behind martin scorseses taxi driver and godfatherbatman rob pattinson scowls as if he came from a twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for selena kylecat woman zoe kravitz the bat and the cat working to save the city from the likes of riddler paul dano penguin colin farrell and crime lord carmine falcone john turturro besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees they offer bruce wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents public and private lives and their untimely deaths although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of heath ledgers multidimensional joker even in his humor together they are a powerful cast of darknessbesides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role reeves gathers expert cinematographer greig fraser and production designer james chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time dark yes obscure no the darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise couldbesides the corruption of city officials the batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance embodied in waynes longing to account for the death of his parents and badboys like riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city in his favor riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals his stalwart ally lt james gordon jeffrey wright realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisorsthe batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve at least not right nowto the strains of nirvanas baleful something in the way they think im hiding in the shadows but i am the shadows batman,neutral
48,hours hero movieit might be quite an adventure for those who expect actionpacked movies like avengers or the dark knightthe batman is not an action movie its a noir detective filmjust enjoy the dark moisty mood this movie hasif you enjoyed movies like zodiac seen im sure youll love itgo to the theatre immediately,positive

51,detective batman at its peak great storyline just as dark a universe as weve come to expect from dc the gloomy gritty dark tone of this film is exactly what i wanted when you think the movie is over theres more beautiful cinematography great score,positive
52,i just got out of the batmanthis movie really wont be for everyone easily the darkest batman movie yet it is gritty depressing and not a fun movie at allthis isnt your usual comic book movie its a detective movie with more in common with seen than previous batman movies the first two thirds of the movie are amazing at one point i turned to my son and said this is a masterpiece everything works and is brilliant i was  enthralled but boy does it drop the ball in the final actof the cast pattinson is great collin farrell is ok zoe kravitz was fine too but she has zero chemistry with pattinson keaton and pfeiffer they are not paul dano though was incredible especially in the scene in arkham whilst geoffrey wright is as great as he always ison the downside it does have some pacing issues and is really too long though im not sure what id cut and i really wasnt keen on the ending i dont know if it is a comic book storyline they did as i think the final act really lets the movie down its here in the final act that you feel the movies run timei was surprised there were only  other people in my screening,negative
53,i have been absolutely fizzing to see the batman from the day it was announced but even more so from when i first heard it described as being inspired by seen  one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time were we finally going to get the raw and gritty batman film id always dreamed of seeing we certainly werewhere to begin the biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with batman as batman there is very little of bruce wayne in this movie and im absolutely fine with that the movie is batmans story and we are with him from start to finish we even get some narration from him which im not quite sure how i feel about just yet it was very good narration but im not sure hes a character i want it fromthe riddler in this movie is phenomenal after the joker in the dark knight this is absolutely my second favourite batman film villain he was clearly inspired by the zodiac killer and what an inspired choice also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius these are very clever riddles and puzzles and make batman have to do some serious detective work  something ive always wanted more of from him in the previous filmsthis is my favourite incarnation of catwoman to date i havent loved her characters place in the films in the past ive found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of batman that i havent enjoyed in this film though she was used perfectly shes the love interest and a villainantihero all in one that is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a batman film  the pointless love interestthe penguin was probably the one letdown for me from what id seen in the trailer i suspected this may be the case im wondering if they were using this movie as a setup for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do in this one though i just found him quite a dull screenpresencerobert pattinson as batman blew me away he looked great and his voice was perfect he was extremely intense and very menacing even though i knew he was more than capable of playing the role i think i still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes he absolutely did and then somethe film has quite a unique feel there are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both tim burtons batman universe and christopher nolans universe but then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of the batman it basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into its own style  while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also its very well done in that sensethe batmobile in this movie is awesome theres just no other way to put it the sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bonechilling the chase sequence in this movie with the penguin is one of the best ive ever seenthe film is long at just under  hours but it really never feels like it theres a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while that really is the only flat part of the movie however the rest happens at a breakneck paceits hard to find enough good things to say about this movie i need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer but for now i have it firmly sitting in second place behind the dark knight in my order of favourite batman films,neutral
54,the riddlerpaul dano spoton how did it take this long for him to get a role like this targets public officials revealing their corruption and killing them in gruesome fashionhow did this get away with a pg again oh right as long as you dont show the details then you can get away with almost anything by now even a barely toned down jigsaw in order to stop him it will be necessary for the bat and the catwith amazing chemistry together to stop the rat thanks matti really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with bruce waynes alterego how about nightwing i know its not likely but part of me still holds out hope that grayson will be turned into a featureif youve never checked out the trailer on youtube youre missing out but somehow this managed to convince me fingers crossed for at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast the closest weve come to someone who shouldnt be doing it is george clooney and its not like anybody came out of that flick looking good he took that job after doing from dusk till dawn there was good reason to think that he was going to be badass honestly everyone here gives a strong performancesomething that will definitely appeal to some more than others is the genre and tone this is essentially seen meets zodiac it is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster while the action is great especially the martial arts not to mention that car chase theres less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the nolan trilogywhich also has far more escalation essentially this just isnt focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon and i think we can all agree that weve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested in conveying to the audience that theres a reason hes called the worlds greatest detective weve barely seen it outside of the animated ones before so im very happy with that choice by themin addition to what ive already mentioned this features some drugs suggestive material and strong language i recommend this to any fan of batman ,positive
55,star rating  brilliant  very good  okay  poor  awfulgotham city is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures by a sadistic killer calling himself the riddler paul dano who holds the city to ransom revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped the batman robert pattinson the alter ego of millionaire bruce wayne starts an investigation of his own crossing paths with a woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz who operates as catwoman and wants to find out what happened to her friend it sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of gothams underworld including notorious gangster the penguin an unrecognisable colin farrell and crime boss carmine falcone john turturro who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their livesthe batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation here writerdirector matt reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever less doesnt seem to be more anymore at least not to the cinema artistes but from this end all i can see is a film drowning in its own indulgencereeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak heavy tone established by christopher nolan and so we have a gotham city with seemingly endless heavy rain and gloomy skies set against pattinsons dark brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack its just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light even more overdone is danos dark riddler operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous thrown in to this is the topical social justice speeches that litter film and tv today with kravitzs catwoman even praising the sinister villain who were meant to hate at one point for killing all these white privileged aholes its just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket over ambitious and overlong and by the time of the main villains grand master plan at the end youre too overwhelmed or bored to careeveryone else can think what they like but personally this is one of the most pretentious batmans ever which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent or at least had an old fashioned lawrence of arabia style intermission at some point,negative
56,everything about this movie is trying too hard  the over dramatic score the long shots on characters faces the overacting the complex crime story  it all feels like its trying to get an oscar in every momentits overly long drawn out and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into itthis movie is not a masterpiece but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is,negative
57,im not sure where to begin as i dont generally want to spoil the reveals but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic for the batman matt reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as batman year one hush and batman the long halloween reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as the french connection zodiac and the noir classic chinatown the general feel of the movie sought to relate batman in the detective role that hes famous for in the comics but unfortunately ignores any attempt at batmans level of crime  mysterythe acting was really good theres a great cast of professionals in this film although robert patterson isnt allowed a range of emotion bruce wayne and batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emokid who walks through life with severe lethargy colin farrell is unrecognizable as the penguin and dare i say gave the greatest performance of his life a large portion of the film is writing out a semiorigin story for oswald cobblepot and his rise to become gothams crime boss a lot of the villains are the origin stories here batman the character is basically introduced the way he is in batman year two and i thought that was a mistake year one of batman would have been wonderful on screen the audience seeing bruce wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movies everyone is just scared of him plot device zoe kravitzs performance as selena kyle becoming cat woman was underdeveloped as she was so much fun to watch in the batman that id like to see this spinoff into a standalone cat woman release jeffery wright was brilliant of course even remaining quiet in the batmans background he pulled the attention onto himself mostly because pattersons portrayal was incredibly stiff paul dano as the riddler was exactly what i wanted to see in this movie the character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with carmine falcone john turturro was great as the crime boss falcone but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings it dragged on so long that it bored me completely i went into the batman to see him match wits with a clever serial killer not be reeducated about the connection between thomas wayne  carmine falcone againthe action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way i knew before hand that reeves lifted from some older better known films but its as if they dropped the budget on these scenes batman racing to catch the penguin was an old muscle car batmobile versus what im guessing was a s buick i was laughing at this chase scene it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if penguin were in an expensive italian sports car i might have enjoyed it but it was literally a suppedup car desperately trying to out pace my moms car the fighting was dull hand to hand combat is one of the first things bruce wayne learns before donning the cowl but in this movie batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at so much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills that i wondered where the editor wasthe batman is simply too long its a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of its own significance it fails at cohesive storytelling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score unlike the dark knight before it  i wont watch it again,negative
58,matt reeves the batman is a hell of a movie it is the darkest live action batman movie ever made and the longest one too the batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting but its cinematic too the cinematography was just incredible michael giacchino the batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever its enduringly great the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when batman shows up it really making me hyped more because of that colin farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as the penguin paul dano performance is giving me a heath ledger joker vibes but not trying to be heath ledger joker which is still great paul dano the riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain zoe kravits performances as catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as michelle pfeiffer and the catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for zoe and i did still like her a lot in here and in the end we got the batman himself robert pattinson all i can say about him as the batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play the batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome batman now he was become my second favorite batman next to christian bale in number one still the story of the batman itself is great and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow its not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster if its only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that but at in the end the batman is still a hell of a great movie its still amazing and its still incredible i was impress by most of the thing that happens i was excited i was hyped i was stunt by all the amazing thing that theyve done the batman is fire,positive
59,the headline can be taken two ways if you remove any hype or expectations saying its a good movie is positive but if you are hoping for an amazing new batman iteration good means it wasnt great let alone amazingthis review will come off as negative but i did enjoy it i love the tone its super dark and grounded in reality even more than the nolan trilogy and it feels true to the character zoe kravitz and jeffrey wright are great casting choices its a mostly wellmade film and a good addition to the franchise and the bat suit looks awesomeat the same time nothing about this movie wowed me i did not connect with the characters especially the villain the relationships seem undeveloped and not organic i was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as i should have been it mostly feels surface levelif youre a huge batman fan i think you will really enjoy it but as a movie i dont think it fires on all cylinders the nolan trilogy still reigns supreme  viewing fan early screening,neutral
60,wasnt a fan of emo batman sorry robert pattinson film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate christopher nolan and david fincher in the end the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a runofthemill superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill the riddler was a bit lame too forgotten most of the movie and characters already underwhelming,negative
61,couldnt even finish this drivel firstly  pattinson is a good actor but doesnt fit batmans role film is way too long and boring  action is underwhelming overall a big disappointment cant recommend it at all,negative
62,i went in with ultralow expectations because i think robert pattison is a godawful actor and this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that you can always go lowerim actually angry i wasted  hours of my life and trust me every minute of that time was felthowever lets have some positives cinematography is great and the music is fantastic the opening scenes with the batman made me think i was going to have another heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something specialbut then the film gets going part saw ripoff and so desperately wants to be seen in its execution the story dragged you dont care about any of the characters and i found myself pining for clooney and his batnipples and mr freezewhat i found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with nolan and warned him were going to make a better batman than you no just nolike the last lord of the rings film this has an ending that just keeps on coming something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave the film continues something else is wrapped up and you think thats it and it keeps going something else and on and on and oni can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through and no im not joking welcome to southamptonwith regards to the plank of wood sorry pattison in the initial scenes i was genuinely excited never a fan of his costume before seeing it here  suddenly i got it he proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack they get back up in fact everyone he batpunches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again theres no real threat here when bale smacked someone down they stayed dead but then when bale stripped off same as affleck they were built robert looked like me and i look like mr burns from the simpsons a skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever in fact when robert bent over in one topless scene his bones stuck out and i thought wings were going to pop out but then why wouldnt they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role i would have sacked him there and thenhis time as bruce is strictly limited  thank god  so you cant really judge him for that as bruce he just stands there and looks confused as the batman by the end he became a parody his batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke batman in the college humour videos a is for alfred  genius when he was mad it just look like he was pulling a cumface and dont even get me started on the adrian mole diary keeping thats going in with the voiceover narrationhonestly with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so i have never hated a film so much as i did this and given i went in with low expectations even i am surprised at how fuming i am at myself for wasting my time on it,negative
63,matt reeves is not a good director at all hes made one decent film rise of the planet of the apes and everything else hes done falls into one of two categories junk and overrated junk thank goodness the batman is at least the latter instead of the former if the director wasnt trying sooooo hard to make the film dark maybe he could have created a new category of just overratedfirstly david fincher himself is bad enough but david fincher imitations are even worse this movies rote serialkiller plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that nolan already played around with most notably the but he wanted to be captured eyeroller also irritating are reeves cheap attempts to desecrate schuberts music while indulging the trope of the classical musicloving psychopath modern cultures obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peevesthey are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same exchange the riddler for any of the killers in finchers movies and there is basically no difference and it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the riddlers petty mind games  if i was there i would promptly tell him to pss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere even if there was a bomb strapped to my necksecondly the casting is sometimes bizarre dc has often thrived on unorthodox castingif they can make ben affleck work as batman anything goesbut they trip up here since we have the highwater mark of the nolan trilogy to compare it to andy serkis as alfred that completely does not work he just lacks the sophistication of michael caine the new commissioner gordon is no gary oldman thats for sure the riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate heath ledger the riddler from the  batman show was vastly superiorheck jim carrey was the new catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry on and on about some friend of hers that ends up killed why shes so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even batman dares solve the closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable colin farrell as the penguin the car chase scene was great even as i kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the roadthirdly the pacing is off ive seen people accuse nolan of being portentous but the batman takes it to a whole new level with its bloated runtime it doesnt even have the quasigrandeur of the snyder cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the penguins club ad nauseam reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by alfred hitchcock but other than a rear window throwback in the opening scene i dont see it the film is mostly shot like a generic tv procedural filtered through a david fincher lens and reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made hitchcock so sublime compare any riddler murder to the one in dial m for murder which is one of the more mediocre hitchcocks reeves sole technique for suspense is to have the riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters aboutugh if any good this would have become dcs highest grossing film ever as it is people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop,negative
64,the batman  is a movie my wife and i caught an advanced screening of last night the storyline follows gotham shortly after the batman has emerged and established himself in the streets a serial killer known as the riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within gothams hierarchy until bruce wayne in inevitably the target how are all of these people tied together and can batman tie the pieces together before wayne is the next victimthis movie is directed by matt reeves cloverfield and stars robert pattinson twilight zo kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano there will be blood john turturro do the right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord of the rings jeffrey wright shaft and barry keoghan eternalsthe storyline look and feel of this movie is an a the characters are perfectly cast and well executed farrell dano and kravitz were a this movie does a fantastic job of depicting the batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent this also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end this has a very good jeph loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the detective elements of batman the violence was also brilliant and very well done i will say this did not need to be hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited this film likely should have been a hair under  and a half hoursoverall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for batman fans i would score this a   and strongly recommend it,positive
65,the batman   robert pattinson zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell paul dano john turturro andy serkis peter sarsgaard filmmaker matt reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the bob kane comic book hero with pattinson standing tall and brooding as bruce wayne employing vigilante style justice as the caped cursader while gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal riddler dano affectively disturbing and gaining an unlikely ally in selina kyle asskicking kravitz in precatwoman mode arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by greig fraser and james chinlunds production design all aided by the foreboding score by michael giacchino full of bombast and dread farrell under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics has a field day in getting in touch with his inner robert de niro as the penguin by all means see it in imax,positive
66,i will say i liked the story but the long dragged out and slowly paced near  hours was ridiculous you could watch this at x speed and it would be more enjoyable this needed at least  mins cut out and much faster storytelling and the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fasti do like pattinson as an actor but not as batman in this one he wasnt convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy and thats him both as batman and even more so as bruce wayneand whats with colin farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the penguin was every other actor that naturally has that characters look unavailable its not like farrell has a particular set of penguin skills lol casting farrell as batman and pattinson as penguin now that wouldve worked much better imoim also a big fan of westworlds jeffrey wright but here again he was very unconvincing as gordon especially when he also had that monotonic whispering emo demeanor i get that director and joint writer reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme but instead the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throatsthe only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful kravitz who stole the entire show i wouldve rather watched a  hour movie with just her as catwomanall the affleck keaton bale kilmer and even clooney batman characters were much more convincing as well as having more and better keep you awake action in said filmssadly this one is a generous yet disappointing  from me,negative
67,robert p is a terrible batman absolutely no batcharisma at all the riddler character is a complete bore i hated all of this film i certainly do not understand the good reviews its not close to the dark knight caliber please do not make a sequel,negative
68,for better or worse mostly better the batman is when hes detective first superhero second a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesnt hurt really if were having a new batman film especially if it took a riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together,neutral
69,to preface this review i will say when watching this in the cinemas many people walked out i was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie deliversthe actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain the riddler and the batman penguin was by far the coolest and best actor honestly a good fellas type character all other supporting actors were also quite good i however think robert pattinson a horrible pick for batman the whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid i was half expecting him to say gosh get outta my room absolutely trash acting the riddler was even worse he was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable his video calls reminded me of the horror films my  year old class mates had made in high school their budgets were the relationship between the batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie the romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension they rode around in their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cutethe bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a batman film the old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lienow to answer everyones questions i do think robert pattinson was a terrible choice for batman for a few reasons at first i had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role he just isnt a badass over masculine kinda guy like at all he seems awkward and it shows his voice wasnt that great his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad the guy is ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors the story was god awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die bombs go off and some personal people batman knows get injured then batman goes welp i cant be in  places at once im only human and proceeds to get kod twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights he is by far the worst and weakest looking batman with the worst actor to have played him the cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible did i mention this film is  hours long to have a crap middle and end well know i know wow i couldnt wait for thr  hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished definitely wouldnt reccomend this garbage piece of cinema  for me,negative
70,i never thought that i would view a worse dc movie than catwoman or the harley quinn movie i was sorely mistaken the batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation the casting was wrong  there was not one cast member who had a good performance the script was pitiful  it was too long and all over the place the direction was terrible and the editing was questionablenothing was a positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery,negative
71,ill say it started pretty good and i liked the cinematography but i thought it dragged on and the social commentary on destroying white privileged men was ironic as thats what batman is a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because hes rich and has all the free time to do so and we feel for him because boo boo hes an orphan this was a very obvious woke fest i like the diversity but its when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey pattinson was so sleepy like joe biden in a batman suit sleepy joker is my favorite movie of all time and i feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps i did like farrell as the penguin and the riddler was basically dexter the antihero,neutral
72,its a big city i cant be everywhere batman rob pattisona more complete adaptation of the batman comics presence there isnt and no more gothic spoton condemnation of human frailty since the yearold godfather writerdirector matt reeves the batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the american soul in its corruption and its salvation as an achievement of robust american neo noir it ranks somewhere behind martin scorseses taxi driver and godfatherbatman rob pattinson scowls as if he came from a twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for selena kylecat woman zoe kravitz the bat and the cat working to save the city from the likes of riddler paul dano penguin colin farrell and crime lord carmine falcone john turturro besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees they offer bruce wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents public and private lives and their untimely deaths although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of heath ledgers multidimensional joker even in his humor together they are a powerful cast of darknessbesides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role reeves gathers expert cinematographer greig fraser and production designer james chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time dark yes obscure no the darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise couldbesides the corruption of city officials the batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance embodied in waynes longing to account for the death of his parents and badboys like riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city in his favor riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals his stalwart ally lt james gordon jeffrey wright realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisorsthe batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve at least not right nowto the strains of nirvanas baleful something in the way they think im hiding in the shadows but i am the shadows batman,neutral
73,hours hero movieit might be quite an adventure for those who expect actionpacked movies like avengers or the dark knightthe batman is not an action movie its a noir detective filmjust enjoy the dark moisty mood this movie hasif you enjoyed movies like zodiac seen im sure youll love itgo to the theatre immediately,positive

76,detective batman at its peak great storyline just as dark a universe as weve come to expect from dc the gloomy gritty dark tone of this film is exactly what i wanted when you think the movie is over theres more beautiful cinematography great score,positive
77,i just got out of the batmanthis movie really wont be for everyone easily the darkest batman movie yet it is gritty depressing and not a fun movie at allthis isnt your usual comic book movie its a detective movie with more in common with seen than previous batman movies the first two thirds of the movie are amazing at one point i turned to my son and said this is a masterpiece everything works and is brilliant i was  enthralled but boy does it drop the ball in the final actof the cast pattinson is great collin farrell is ok zoe kravitz was fine too but she has zero chemistry with pattinson keaton and pfeiffer they are not paul dano though was incredible especially in the scene in arkham whilst geoffrey wright is as great as he always ison the downside it does have some pacing issues and is really too long though im not sure what id cut and i really wasnt keen on the ending i dont know if it is a comic book storyline they did as i think the final act really lets the movie down its here in the final act that you feel the movies run timei was surprised there were only  other people in my screening,negative
78,i have been absolutely fizzing to see the batman from the day it was announced but even more so from when i first heard it described as being inspired by seen  one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time were we finally going to get the raw and gritty batman film id always dreamed of seeing we certainly werewhere to begin the biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with batman as batman there is very little of bruce wayne in this movie and im absolutely fine with that the movie is batmans story and we are with him from start to finish we even get some narration from him which im not quite sure how i feel about just yet it was very good narration but im not sure hes a character i want it fromthe riddler in this movie is phenomenal after the joker in the dark knight this is absolutely my second favourite batman film villain he was clearly inspired by the zodiac killer and what an inspired choice also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius these are very clever riddles and puzzles and make batman have to do some serious detective work  something ive always wanted more of from him in the previous filmsthis is my favourite incarnation of catwoman to date i havent loved her characters place in the films in the past ive found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of batman that i havent enjoyed in this film though she was used perfectly shes the love interest and a villainantihero all in one that is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a batman film  the pointless love interestthe penguin was probably the one letdown for me from what id seen in the trailer i suspected this may be the case im wondering if they were using this movie as a setup for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do in this one though i just found him quite a dull screenpresencerobert pattinson as batman blew me away he looked great and his voice was perfect he was extremely intense and very menacing even though i knew he was more than capable of playing the role i think i still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes he absolutely did and then somethe film has quite a unique feel there are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both tim burtons batman universe and christopher nolans universe but then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of the batman it basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into its own style  while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also its very well done in that sensethe batmobile in this movie is awesome theres just no other way to put it the sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bonechilling the chase sequence in this movie with the penguin is one of the best ive ever seenthe film is long at just under  hours but it really never feels like it theres a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while that really is the only flat part of the movie however the rest happens at a breakneck paceits hard to find enough good things to say about this movie i need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer but for now i have it firmly sitting in second place behind the dark knight in my order of favourite batman films,neutral
79,the riddlerpaul dano spoton how did it take this long for him to get a role like this targets public officials revealing their corruption and killing them in gruesome fashionhow did this get away with a pg again oh right as long as you dont show the details then you can get away with almost anything by now even a barely toned down jigsaw in order to stop him it will be necessary for the bat and the catwith amazing chemistry together to stop the rat thanks matti really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with bruce waynes alterego how about nightwing i know its not likely but part of me still holds out hope that grayson will be turned into a featureif youve never checked out the trailer on youtube youre missing out but somehow this managed to convince me fingers crossed for at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast the closest weve come to someone who shouldnt be doing it is george clooney and its not like anybody came out of that flick looking good he took that job after doing from dusk till dawn there was good reason to think that he was going to be badass honestly everyone here gives a strong performancesomething that will definitely appeal to some more than others is the genre and tone this is essentially seen meets zodiac it is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster while the action is great especially the martial arts not to mention that car chase theres less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the nolan trilogywhich also has far more escalation essentially this just isnt focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon and i think we can all agree that weve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested in conveying to the audience that theres a reason hes called the worlds greatest detective weve barely seen it outside of the animated ones before so im very happy with that choice by themin addition to what ive already mentioned this features some drugs suggestive material and strong language i recommend this to any fan of batman ,positive
80,star rating  brilliant  very good  okay  poor  awfulgotham city is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures by a sadistic killer calling himself the riddler paul dano who holds the city to ransom revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped the batman robert pattinson the alter ego of millionaire bruce wayne starts an investigation of his own crossing paths with a woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz who operates as catwoman and wants to find out what happened to her friend it sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of gothams underworld including notorious gangster the penguin an unrecognisable colin farrell and crime boss carmine falcone john turturro who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their livesthe batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation here writerdirector matt reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever less doesnt seem to be more anymore at least not to the cinema artistes but from this end all i can see is a film drowning in its own indulgencereeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak heavy tone established by christopher nolan and so we have a gotham city with seemingly endless heavy rain and gloomy skies set against pattinsons dark brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack its just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light even more overdone is danos dark riddler operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous thrown in to this is the topical social justice speeches that litter film and tv today with kravitzs catwoman even praising the sinister villain who were meant to hate at one point for killing all these white privileged aholes its just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket over ambitious and overlong and by the time of the main villains grand master plan at the end youre too overwhelmed or bored to careeveryone else can think what they like but personally this is one of the most pretentious batmans ever which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent or at least had an old fashioned lawrence of arabia style intermission at some point,negative
81,everything about this movie is trying too hard  the over dramatic score the long shots on characters faces the overacting the complex crime story  it all feels like its trying to get an oscar in every momentits overly long drawn out and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into itthis movie is not a masterpiece but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is,negative
82,im not sure where to begin as i dont generally want to spoil the reveals but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic for the batman matt reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as batman year one hush and batman the long halloween reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as the french connection zodiac and the noir classic chinatown the general feel of the movie sought to relate batman in the detective role that hes famous for in the comics but unfortunately ignores any attempt at batmans level of crime  mysterythe acting was really good theres a great cast of professionals in this film although robert patterson isnt allowed a range of emotion bruce wayne and batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emokid who walks through life with severe lethargy colin farrell is unrecognizable as the penguin and dare i say gave the greatest performance of his life a large portion of the film is writing out a semiorigin story for oswald cobblepot and his rise to become gothams crime boss a lot of the villains are the origin stories here batman the character is basically introduced the way he is in batman year two and i thought that was a mistake year one of batman would have been wonderful on screen the audience seeing bruce wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movies everyone is just scared of him plot device zoe kravitzs performance as selena kyle becoming cat woman was underdeveloped as she was so much fun to watch in the batman that id like to see this spinoff into a standalone cat woman release jeffery wright was brilliant of course even remaining quiet in the batmans background he pulled the attention onto himself mostly because pattersons portrayal was incredibly stiff paul dano as the riddler was exactly what i wanted to see in this movie the character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with carmine falcone john turturro was great as the crime boss falcone but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings it dragged on so long that it bored me completely i went into the batman to see him match wits with a clever serial killer not be reeducated about the connection between thomas wayne  carmine falcone againthe action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way i knew before hand that reeves lifted from some older better known films but its as if they dropped the budget on these scenes batman racing to catch the penguin was an old muscle car batmobile versus what im guessing was a s buick i was laughing at this chase scene it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if penguin were in an expensive italian sports car i might have enjoyed it but it was literally a suppedup car desperately trying to out pace my moms car the fighting was dull hand to hand combat is one of the first things bruce wayne learns before donning the cowl but in this movie batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at so much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills that i wondered where the editor wasthe batman is simply too long its a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of its own significance it fails at cohesive storytelling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score unlike the dark knight before it  i wont watch it again,negative
83,matt reeves the batman is a hell of a movie it is the darkest live action batman movie ever made and the longest one too the batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting but its cinematic too the cinematography was just incredible michael giacchino the batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever its enduringly great the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when batman shows up it really making me hyped more because of that colin farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as the penguin paul dano performance is giving me a heath ledger joker vibes but not trying to be heath ledger joker which is still great paul dano the riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain zoe kravits performances as catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as michelle pfeiffer and the catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for zoe and i did still like her a lot in here and in the end we got the batman himself robert pattinson all i can say about him as the batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play the batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome batman now he was become my second favorite batman next to christian bale in number one still the story of the batman itself is great and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow its not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster if its only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that but at in the end the batman is still a hell of a great movie its still amazing and its still incredible i was impress by most of the thing that happens i was excited i was hyped i was stunt by all the amazing thing that theyve done the batman is fire,positive
84,the headline can be taken two ways if you remove any hype or expectations saying its a good movie is positive but if you are hoping for an amazing new batman iteration good means it wasnt great let alone amazingthis review will come off as negative but i did enjoy it i love the tone its super dark and grounded in reality even more than the nolan trilogy and it feels true to the character zoe kravitz and jeffrey wright are great casting choices its a mostly wellmade film and a good addition to the franchise and the bat suit looks awesomeat the same time nothing about this movie wowed me i did not connect with the characters especially the villain the relationships seem undeveloped and not organic i was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as i should have been it mostly feels surface levelif youre a huge batman fan i think you will really enjoy it but as a movie i dont think it fires on all cylinders the nolan trilogy still reigns supreme  viewing fan early screening,neutral
85,wasnt a fan of emo batman sorry robert pattinson film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate christopher nolan and david fincher in the end the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a runofthemill superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill the riddler was a bit lame too forgotten most of the movie and characters already underwhelming,negative
86,couldnt even finish this drivel firstly  pattinson is a good actor but doesnt fit batmans role film is way too long and boring  action is underwhelming overall a big disappointment cant recommend it at all,negative
87,i went in with ultralow expectations because i think robert pattison is a godawful actor and this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that you can always go lowerim actually angry i wasted  hours of my life and trust me every minute of that time was felthowever lets have some positives cinematography is great and the music is fantastic the opening scenes with the batman made me think i was going to have another heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something specialbut then the film gets going part saw ripoff and so desperately wants to be seen in its execution the story dragged you dont care about any of the characters and i found myself pining for clooney and his batnipples and mr freezewhat i found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with nolan and warned him were going to make a better batman than you no just nolike the last lord of the rings film this has an ending that just keeps on coming something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave the film continues something else is wrapped up and you think thats it and it keeps going something else and on and on and oni can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through and no im not joking welcome to southamptonwith regards to the plank of wood sorry pattison in the initial scenes i was genuinely excited never a fan of his costume before seeing it here  suddenly i got it he proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack they get back up in fact everyone he batpunches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again theres no real threat here when bale smacked someone down they stayed dead but then when bale stripped off same as affleck they were built robert looked like me and i look like mr burns from the simpsons a skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever in fact when robert bent over in one topless scene his bones stuck out and i thought wings were going to pop out but then why wouldnt they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role i would have sacked him there and thenhis time as bruce is strictly limited  thank god  so you cant really judge him for that as bruce he just stands there and looks confused as the batman by the end he became a parody his batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke batman in the college humour videos a is for alfred  genius when he was mad it just look like he was pulling a cumface and dont even get me started on the adrian mole diary keeping thats going in with the voiceover narrationhonestly with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so i have never hated a film so much as i did this and given i went in with low expectations even i am surprised at how fuming i am at myself for wasting my time on it,negative
88,matt reeves is not a good director at all hes made one decent film rise of the planet of the apes and everything else hes done falls into one of two categories junk and overrated junk thank goodness the batman is at least the latter instead of the former if the director wasnt trying sooooo hard to make the film dark maybe he could have created a new category of just overratedfirstly david fincher himself is bad enough but david fincher imitations are even worse this movies rote serialkiller plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that nolan already played around with most notably the but he wanted to be captured eyeroller also irritating are reeves cheap attempts to desecrate schuberts music while indulging the trope of the classical musicloving psychopath modern cultures obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peevesthey are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same exchange the riddler for any of the killers in finchers movies and there is basically no difference and it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the riddlers petty mind games  if i was there i would promptly tell him to pss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere even if there was a bomb strapped to my necksecondly the casting is sometimes bizarre dc has often thrived on unorthodox castingif they can make ben affleck work as batman anything goesbut they trip up here since we have the highwater mark of the nolan trilogy to compare it to andy serkis as alfred that completely does not work he just lacks the sophistication of michael caine the new commissioner gordon is no gary oldman thats for sure the riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate heath ledger the riddler from the  batman show was vastly superiorheck jim carrey was the new catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry on and on about some friend of hers that ends up killed why shes so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even batman dares solve the closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable colin farrell as the penguin the car chase scene was great even as i kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the roadthirdly the pacing is off ive seen people accuse nolan of being portentous but the batman takes it to a whole new level with its bloated runtime it doesnt even have the quasigrandeur of the snyder cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the penguins club ad nauseam reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by alfred hitchcock but other than a rear window throwback in the opening scene i dont see it the film is mostly shot like a generic tv procedural filtered through a david fincher lens and reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made hitchcock so sublime compare any riddler murder to the one in dial m for murder which is one of the more mediocre hitchcocks reeves sole technique for suspense is to have the riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters aboutugh if any good this would have become dcs highest grossing film ever as it is people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop,negative
89,the batman  is a movie my wife and i caught an advanced screening of last night the storyline follows gotham shortly after the batman has emerged and established himself in the streets a serial killer known as the riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within gothams hierarchy until bruce wayne in inevitably the target how are all of these people tied together and can batman tie the pieces together before wayne is the next victimthis movie is directed by matt reeves cloverfield and stars robert pattinson twilight zo kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano there will be blood john turturro do the right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord of the rings jeffrey wright shaft and barry keoghan eternalsthe storyline look and feel of this movie is an a the characters are perfectly cast and well executed farrell dano and kravitz were a this movie does a fantastic job of depicting the batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent this also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end this has a very good jeph loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the detective elements of batman the violence was also brilliant and very well done i will say this did not need to be hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited this film likely should have been a hair under  and a half hoursoverall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for batman fans i would score this a   and strongly recommend it,positive
90,the batman   robert pattinson zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell paul dano john turturro andy serkis peter sarsgaard filmmaker matt reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the bob kane comic book hero with pattinson standing tall and brooding as bruce wayne employing vigilante style justice as the caped cursader while gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal riddler dano affectively disturbing and gaining an unlikely ally in selina kyle asskicking kravitz in precatwoman mode arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by greig fraser and james chinlunds production design all aided by the foreboding score by michael giacchino full of bombast and dread farrell under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics has a field day in getting in touch with his inner robert de niro as the penguin by all means see it in imax,positive
91,i will say i liked the story but the long dragged out and slowly paced near  hours was ridiculous you could watch this at x speed and it would be more enjoyable this needed at least  mins cut out and much faster storytelling and the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fasti do like pattinson as an actor but not as batman in this one he wasnt convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy and thats him both as batman and even more so as bruce wayneand whats with colin farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the penguin was every other actor that naturally has that characters look unavailable its not like farrell has a particular set of penguin skills lol casting farrell as batman and pattinson as penguin now that wouldve worked much better imoim also a big fan of westworlds jeffrey wright but here again he was very unconvincing as gordon especially when he also had that monotonic whispering emo demeanor i get that director and joint writer reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme but instead the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throatsthe only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful kravitz who stole the entire show i wouldve rather watched a  hour movie with just her as catwomanall the affleck keaton bale kilmer and even clooney batman characters were much more convincing as well as having more and better keep you awake action in said filmssadly this one is a generous yet disappointing  from me,negative
92,robert p is a terrible batman absolutely no batcharisma at all the riddler character is a complete bore i hated all of this film i certainly do not understand the good reviews its not close to the dark knight caliber please do not make a sequel,negative
93,for better or worse mostly better the batman is when hes detective first superhero second a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesnt hurt really if were having a new batman film especially if it took a riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together,neutral
94,to preface this review i will say when watching this in the cinemas many people walked out i was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie deliversthe actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain the riddler and the batman penguin was by far the coolest and best actor honestly a good fellas type character all other supporting actors were also quite good i however think robert pattinson a horrible pick for batman the whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid i was half expecting him to say gosh get outta my room absolutely trash acting the riddler was even worse he was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable his video calls reminded me of the horror films my  year old class mates had made in high school their budgets were the relationship between the batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie the romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension they rode around in their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cutethe bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a batman film the old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lienow to answer everyones questions i do think robert pattinson was a terrible choice for batman for a few reasons at first i had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role he just isnt a badass over masculine kinda guy like at all he seems awkward and it shows his voice wasnt that great his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad the guy is ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors the story was god awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die bombs go off and some personal people batman knows get injured then batman goes welp i cant be in  places at once im only human and proceeds to get kod twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights he is by far the worst and weakest looking batman with the worst actor to have played him the cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible did i mention this film is  hours long to have a crap middle and end well know i know wow i couldnt wait for thr  hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished definitely wouldnt reccomend this garbage piece of cinema  for me,negative
95,i never thought that i would view a worse dc movie than catwoman or the harley quinn movie i was sorely mistaken the batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation the casting was wrong  there was not one cast member who had a good performance the script was pitiful  it was too long and all over the place the direction was terrible and the editing was questionablenothing was a positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery,negative
96,ill say it started pretty good and i liked the cinematography but i thought it dragged on and the social commentary on destroying white privileged men was ironic as thats what batman is a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because hes rich and has all the free time to do so and we feel for him because boo boo hes an orphan this was a very obvious woke fest i like the diversity but its when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey pattinson was so sleepy like joe biden in a batman suit sleepy joker is my favorite movie of all time and i feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps i did like farrell as the penguin and the riddler was basically dexter the antihero,neutral
97,its a big city i cant be everywhere batman rob pattisona more complete adaptation of the batman comics presence there isnt and no more gothic spoton condemnation of human frailty since the yearold godfather writerdirector matt reeves the batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the american soul in its corruption and its salvation as an achievement of robust american neo noir it ranks somewhere behind martin scorseses taxi driver and godfatherbatman rob pattinson scowls as if he came from a twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for selena kylecat woman zoe kravitz the bat and the cat working to save the city from the likes of riddler paul dano penguin colin farrell and crime lord carmine falcone john turturro besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees they offer bruce wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents public and private lives and their untimely deaths although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of heath ledgers multidimensional joker even in his humor together they are a powerful cast of darknessbesides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role reeves gathers expert cinematographer greig fraser and production designer james chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time dark yes obscure no the darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise couldbesides the corruption of city officials the batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance embodied in waynes longing to account for the death of his parents and badboys like riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city in his favor riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals his stalwart ally lt james gordon jeffrey wright realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisorsthe batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve at least not right nowto the strains of nirvanas baleful something in the way they think im hiding in the shadows but i am the shadows batman,neutral
